# hello-world

I'm learning to code and keep wishing to save backups of my work before major changes. The way I've been doing it sucks. I also keep hearing about GitHub. Figure I can kill two birds with one stone - manage my edits better and learn a powerful collaboration and repository tool. Looking forward to this!
